<h1>Join Spain Sailing for a taste of Rías Baixas</h1>
<h2>This article featured in the October 2024 edition of Geographical

<p>Spain Sailing invites you on a journey through the captivating Rías Baixas, a
    cluster of vast estuaries nestled along Galicia's Atlantic coast. Where
    freshwater rivers meet the cool Atlantic, a thriving ecosystem flourishes,
    teeming with an abundance of shellfish and cephalopods (octopus and squid),
    and other marine species.</p>

    This region boasts a legendary reputation for its exquisite seafood,
    particularly cephalopods like the common octopus, which has been consumed in
    Galicia for millennia. In Galician waters, where local octopus populations
    have increased, they are still caught using traditional small-scale traps
    and are a regular feature on the menus. Spain Sailing's tours showcase this
    culinary heritage with visits to local gems like Cafe Bar O Parque near
    Baiona, where a mobile kiosk serves nothing but octopus and an adjoining bar
    provides refreshing drinks and side dishes.

    Other traditionally caught seafood includes goose barnacles (percebes) which
    are collected by hand. Their natural habitat on the exposed rocky shoreline
    makes harvesting them both difficult and dangerous, but because of their
    high value there are plenty of licenced 'percebeiros' willing to take the
    risk. More common catches are shrimps, prawns, crabs, lobsters, and mussels.

    As you sail with Spain Sailing, keep an eye out for 'bateas', large floating
    platforms serving as ingenious mussel farms. Each has approximately 500
    ropes hanging down to the seabed up to 40 metres below, and is firmly
    anchored to the seabed. On a previous tour, Spain Sailing encountered the
    crew of 'Nuevo Mar y Cielo' (New Sea and Sky), a local fishing boat. Seeing
    their morning haul – roughly 540kg of mussels from three ropes – netted and
    ready for market offered a fascinating glimpse into local, sustainable
    fishing practices.

    'We chatted with the fishermen for quite a while,' says Tom, Spain Sailing's
    experienced skipper. 'To my surprise a particularly large mussel was
    expertly opened up and offered to me to eat. I obliged politely and,
    although I didn't particularly enjoy the overly salty contents, I was
    pleased to have partaken and, perhaps, to have passed some kind of test.
    They very kindly gave us a bag of freshly caught mussels to take with us,
    and I can say that they were truly delicious when our guests onboard our
    yacht had made them into moules mariniere.'

    Spain Sailing is looking forward to another summer of Rias Baixas tours next
    year on their yacht, Marta.
